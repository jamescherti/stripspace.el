It takes two arguments: (START, END), representing the start and end of the

;;; Variables

(defvar stripspace-before-save-hook-depth -99
  "Depth for the hook that removes trailing whitespace in `before-save-hook'.
A negative depth close to -100 (e.g., -99) ensures that this function runs early
in `before-save-hook', allowing other modifications to occur first.

Additionally, `before-save-hook' saves the current column position, which is
later restored in `after-save-hook' when `stripspace-restore-column' is non-nil.

Running this function early in `before-save-hook' ensures that the column
information is saved before all other modifications have been made.

For example, the Reformatter package, which reformats buffers, runs during
`before-save-hook'. Running stripspace beforehand ensures that the column is
saved before reformatting is applied.")

(defvar stripspace-after-save-hook-depth 99
  "Depth for the hook that restores the cursor column in `after-save-hook'.
A positive depth close to 100 (e.g., 99) ensures that this function runs late,
allowing column restoration to occur after all other post-save processing.

For example, the Apheleia package, which reformats buffers, runs during
`after-save-hook'. Running stripspace after it ensures that the column is
restored after reformatting has been completed.")
